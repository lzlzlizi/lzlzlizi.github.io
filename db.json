Therefore, I decided to work for money, and I wanted to work in the industry of VC, although I actually known little about it. However, related majors like finance and economics were too popular, so I chose mathematics-a field having something to do with finance, less popular and more objective-as my undergraduate major in order to get into a relatively good university. \n\n\n\n####################\n\nRecently, I have been desperate and didn't want to anything for I do not remember how long it was. Thus, I decide to write down how I feel and what I really want, form tracing every aspect of my entire life, to find what is the fucking matter with me and figure out what I need to do to feel positive things, or at least to see the chance of feeling them.\n\nI suck when I write things, not to mention when I write in English, but I will still use it, for it may help me get a higher score in TOEFL writing test or for I am not too sensitive when I am not using my mother tongue.\n\n##############################\n\nTo  be honest, I am  very nervous when I am around other people, especially when I have to face some new people. I am nervous because I do not  like them and I can not see how I  can benefit form them. I have to say, that idea is stupid because recently I realized that people are sources of information, which is really important.\n\n**.To be continue.**","source":"_posts/Something1.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Something Lingering in My mind\ndate: 2019-07-25 13:58:15\ntags: \n    - trivial\n    - 胡言乱语\n\n\n---\n\n# Some mental trash\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"no\" border=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" width=330 height=86 src=\"//music.163.com/outchain/player?type=2&id=411356640&auto=1&height=66\"></iframe>\nWho I am?
