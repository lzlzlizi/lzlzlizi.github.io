* Sometimes your insecurities and your inexperience may lead you, too, to embrace other people’s expectations, standards, or values. But you can harness that inexperience to carve out your own path, one that is free of the burden of knowing how things are supposed to be, a path that is defined by its own particular set of reasons. (Natalie Portman 2015 Harvard)
* We  do not accept anything on authority. It doesn’t matter  who says that something is or isn’t true; what matters  is the evidence and logic behind the statement.  (Psychology, Peter Gray)
* People want an authority to tell them how to value things, but they choose this authority not based on facts or results. They choose it because it seems authoritative and familiar.(The Big Short)
* 外科医生的手术技术，从最初的训练来决定，投入多少的热情学习，就能成为相当上手的外科医生，像行云流水般反复练出基本的手技，做出最美的手术视野，这就是理想的手术，无论遇到多艰难的手术，绝对不能放弃患者，这是我的师父教给我的。（DoctorX S5E10）
