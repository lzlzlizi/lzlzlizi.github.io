For some reason, I began to read the book *Feeling Good -The New Mood Therapy* by Dr. David D. Burns. It was supposed to be finished before April this year, however, like many other things, it was procrastinated until now. This page will contain tips that I think will be useful and some related resources.

When I write this, I have read almost half of the book. Thus, I will write from what I am reading right now, and make it up if I still willing to to after my first editing.

In a short sentence, when you feel **down** in a destructive way, most likely, you are tortured by your **distorted unrealistic thoughts**. So, when if you can beat it, you will calm down to do something important, something that will change the world and make it a better place.

## Find the root of your unrealistic thinking

Your problem may resulted form some nonsense that sounds like truth. For example, here are some popular ones:

1. “If someone criticizes me, I feel miserable because this automatically means there is something wrong with me.” 
2.  “To be a truly fulfilled human being, I must be loved. If I am alone, I am bound to be lonely and miserable.” 
3. “My worth as a human being is proportional to what I’ve achieved.” 
4.  “If I don’t perform (or feel or act) perfectly, I have failed.” 

There are two methods offered by the author that can help you find there. The first one is keeping asking yourself why, and find the untenable logic chain. And the other one is DAS test.

### DAS Test

The Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS) test will help you find your mental weakness, which can lead to your automatic negative thinking. 

I have written a simple [Shiny App](https://lzlzlizi.shinyapps.io/dastest/) for this, you can reach it by clicking the super-link "Shiny App". Source code is on the [github](https://github.com/lzlzlizi/LearnShiny/tree/master/DAStest).


For example(random selected), after you have selected answers of  all thirty-five questions, you will see a table like:

|Approval|	Love|	Achievement|	Perfectionism|	Entitlement|Omnipotence	|Autonomy|
|---|---|----|---|---|---|---|
|2.00|	-5.00|	-1.00	|1.00|	1.00|	0.00|	4.00|

And a figure like this:

Positive number indicates your strangeness and negative numbers indicates your weakness in seven different aspects. For simplicity, I won't copy the detailed explanation, but you can find it [here](http://themathersclinic.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/pdfs/Mathers-Clinic-Dysfunctional-Attitude-Scale.pdf).
