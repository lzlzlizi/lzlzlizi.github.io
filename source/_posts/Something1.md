Who I am? That is a interesting question, because I haven't know yet. 

I have a  name, and I give myself a special word-lzlzlizi-as my on-line name. For now, nobody else had used it. This special word can  be traced back to 2011, when I firstly began to own a computer. Although this word can not be pronounced, it has some special meaning, which is about a character-Zhili Xue(portrayed by actor Lu Gao)-in a TV show called "家的N次方". She( the character) is called "栗子姐"(Ms. Chestnut?? Chestnut Sister?? It is strange to translate it into English since western people often directly call others names. Anyway, they call her this because she likes chestnut and Chestnut is pronounced "lizi" in Chinese). Zhili Xue has numerous influences on me, from aesthetic to some choices like major in University. In the show, she was a brilliant New Star in the industry of Venture Capital and a wonderful women. Back then, as a Junior Three in middle school, my dream was to be a great scientist. She gave me my Plan B-Venture Capital and Finance. So, I began to read the famous book - *Principles of Economics*, which gives me a powerful reasoning tool. 

Three years latter, when I failed college entrance examination, I thought I have no chance to be a great scientist, since I couldn't get into top universities. Therefore, I decided to work for money, and I wanted to work in the industry of VC, although I actually known little about it. However, related majors like finance and economics were too popular, so I chose mathematics-a field having something to do with finance, less popular and more objective-as my undergraduate major in order to get into a relatively good university.

Recently, I have been desperate and didn't want to anything for I do not remember how long it was. Thus, I decide to write down how I feel and what I really want, form tracing every aspect of my entire life, to find what is the fucking matter with me and figure out what I need to do to feel positive things, or at least to see the chance of feeling them.

I suck when I write things, not to mention when I write in English, but I will still use it, for it may help me get a higher score in TOEFL writing test or for I am not too sensitive when I am not using my mother tongue.

To  be honest, I am  very nervous when I am around other people, especially when I have to face some new people. I am nervous because I do not  like them and I can not see how I  can benefit form them. I have to say, that idea is stupid because recently I realized that people are sources of information, which is really important.
