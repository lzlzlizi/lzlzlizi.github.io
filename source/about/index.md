# About Me 

**Who I am?** That is a interesting question, because I haven't know yet. 

# Some statements

1. This site is deployed with Google Analytics, which means usually I can know when and in which city there is someone who is  visitting this site(not exactly who). If you do not want to be tracked while for some reason still want to visit some of my pages, please clone the corresponding github repository and read the source markdown file, or use some anonymous tools such as ss and tor. However, if it is not a must, I hope you can just leave it there, because in that way, I can gladly know there is a person who cares about my work. Thanks for your understanding.



**.To be continue.**
