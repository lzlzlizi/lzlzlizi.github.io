# About Me 

**Who I am?** That is a interesting question, because I haven't know yet. 

For a short time, I began to think "revenge"-energy used to power me-is stupid, give it up, and let the nonconfidence in other field impact my academic dream. But, now, I think revenge is not that despicable and is reasonable to me. Also, it is not wise to live in the fantasy, instead, I need to walk towards my dream(And fly or run whenever I want to).

# Some statements

1. This site is deployed with Google Analytics, which means usually I can know when and in which city there is someone who is  visitting this site(not exactly who). If you do not want to be tracked while for some reason still want to visit some of my pages, please clone the corresponding github repository and read the source markdown file, or use some anonymous tools such as ss and tor. However, if it is not a must, I hope you can just leave it there, because in that way, I can gladly know there is a person who cares about my work. Thanks for your understanding.
